          <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey + Other Details</h3></summary>
I remember at a young age trying to play the Wii Mario Kart game without my mom yelling at me to turn it off. Even though I rarely won first place, it was the game itself that always excited me, so I still played it anyway. In middle school, I became fascinated with building video games. After watching hundreds of hours of coding tutorials from the BroCode YouTube channel and learning algorithms from my mentor, I was ready to create my own video game. I envisioned a 2D platform game where a fox ventures through a vibrant world, collecting food to feed its family while navigating through various obstacles. As I delved into C# programming, I learned about object-oriented principles and applied them to create the fox character, food items, and obstacles. Implementing collision detection, animation sequences, and scoring systems were also pivotal aspects that added depth to the game. It took months to finish my fox game but the end product turned out to be better than I expected. In high school, I became captivated by applications. I created an Indian Food Tracker app that combined my passion for technology and my love for Indian cuisine. Utilizing my Python skills, I designed an intuitive app where users could log their meals, and the app would provide detailed insights into the nutritional value, offering a holistic approach to health tracking. Every time I was solving those little Exceptions and Syntax errors from the day I began to code, I realized that any problem in my life had a solution. I could either modify the code and right the wrong, or just keep compiling them, producing no output. So, life is not all that different. That is why I want to pursue computer science in college. I know I can work to keep myself happy. Inevitably, what makes me happy is computer science, which is what I want to pursue.
